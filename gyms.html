        <section id="bulba-gym-section" class="intro-container">

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="0">
            Pewter City — Brock<br><br>
            A strong opening. Brock’s Geodude and Onix are both Rock/Ground, making them extremely vulnerable to your Grass attacks. They can barely scratch you in return.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="1">
            Cerulean City — Misty<br><br>
            Misty’s Water-types—Staryu and Starmie—struggle to do any damage, while Bulbasaur can take them down with ease. A clear advantage.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="2">
            Vermilion City — Lt. Surge<br><br>
            Surge’s Electric-types hit lightly thanks to your resistance. You won’t deal super-effective damage, but you’re safe and steady here.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="3">
            Celadon City — Erika<br><br>
            Erika’s team is mostly Grass/Poison, which resists your attacks and can drag the fight out. Neither side has a clear edge, but it’s a slow match.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="4">
            Fuchsia City — Koga<br><br>
            Koga’s Poison-types are dangerous. While you resist some of their secondary attacks, Bulbasaur’s Poison typing leaves it exposed to Psychic moves and status effects. Not a great matchup.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="5">
            Saffron City — Sabrina<br><br>
            A serious threat. Sabrina’s Psychic-types strike directly at your Poison typing. You’re at a heavy disadvantage here and will need strong allies to cover this gap.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="6">
            Cinnabar Island — Blaine<br><br>
            This is your worst matchup. Blaine’s team is fast and built around powerful Fire moves that tear through you. Avoid using Bulbasaur if possible.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="7">
            Viridian City — Giovanni<br><br>
            A strong finish. Giovanni’s Ground-heavy team is weak to Grass, and Bulbasaur can dominate if you watch out for any Fire-type coverage. One of your better matchups.
          </p>
          <p class="speech-box upcoming gym-slide bulba" data-gym="8">
            That’s the full Gym circuit, <strong><span id="nameOutput2">sis</span></strong>!<br><br>
            With your partner <strong>Bulbasaur</strong>, you’ve faced tough matchups and emerged stronger each time.<br><br>
            But the real challenge still lies ahead...
          </p>
          <p class="speech-box upcoming" data-gym="9">
            So how does <strong>Bulbasaur</strong> match up against the Elite Four?<br><br><br><br>
            - <strong>Lorelei</strong> (Ice/Water): mixed. You resist Water but Ice is deadly. Not a good lead.<br>
            - <strong>Bruno</strong> (Fighting/Rock): decent. Watch out for coverage, but Grass helps vs. Onix.<br>
            - <strong>Agatha</strong> (Ghost/Poison): poor. Bulbasaur has no advantage here.<br>
            - <strong>Lance</strong> (Dragon/Flying): very bad. You’re weak to Flying and can't hit back effectively.<br><br><br><br>
            Consider rotating your team before the League — <strong>Bulbasaur</strong> carried early, but won’t sweep the endgame alone.
          </p>
          <p class="speech-box upcoming" data-gym="10">
            And then… it all comes down to the Champion.<br><br>
            Whether they lead with Charizard, Blastoise, or Venusaur, your rival won’t go easy on you.<br><br>
            <strong>Bulbasaur</strong> can hold its own — but only if you’ve built smart around its weaknesses.<br><br>
            Fire. Flying. Psychic. This is your biggest test yet.<br><br><br><br>
            <strong><span id="nameOutput3">sis</span>, you’ve made it further than most Trainers ever will.</strong><br><br>
            Your journey began with one choice — and look how far it’s taken you.<br><br>
            The title is within reach now.<br>
            Don’t stop.
          </p>
          <p class="speech-box upcoming" data-gym="11">
            <strong>PROFESSOR BOHDAN:</strong><br><br>
            You did it, <strong><span id="nameOutput4">sis</span></strong>.<br><br>
            You conquered every Gym in Kanto and made it to the very top.<br><br>
            I’m proud of you — and I hope your Pokémon are too.<br><br><br><br>
            But tell me...<br><br>
